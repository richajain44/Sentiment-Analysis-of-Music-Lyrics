# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Music-Lyrics
The datset is the Kaggle 55,000+ song dataset. It is an unlabelled dataset which is labelled with 
majority voting of three different lexicons-NRC, SentiWordnet, SentiStrength.
Once the dataset is labelled, three ML algorithms- Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Adaboost are applied and an ensemble of all the three 
is created. Accuracy of 80% is obtained.
